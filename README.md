In this project I had used six different Machine Learning models namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, 
AdaBoost, Random Forest. At the end of the project I got to know which model gives the best accuracy by telling about 
the quality of the water. 

Certain libraries were also used like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sk-learn with the help of which we imported training and test
data, standard scaler, matrix, classification report and confusion matrix.
